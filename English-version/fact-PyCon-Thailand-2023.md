During the PyCon Thailand 2023 (Lightning Talk), at minute 02:43, Mr. Boat displayed a slide with a picture of him and another person, with the text "between bf and gf" on the slide. He then narrated that the person in the picture was "My girlfriend."
Although he later said "Just Kidding" regarding the story about fighting over a Code Editor, the overall presentation was designed to mislead the audience into believing that the two individuals were actually in a relationship.
The Reality: That relationship did not exist. He fabricated a false narrative by using another person's image and personal information to support his presentation. This aligns with his pattern of misrepresenting personal matters, as noted in this repository.
