What Boat posted to attack the event's standards was presented in a manner as if it were a problem with the team's professionalism. But in reality, the key issue is not about the event's standards at all. Instead, it is about the poster's own expectations regarding the selection results for himself. The session that Boat submitted did not align with the event's objectives and did not address the needs of the target audience as required by the event, so it was not selected. This is a normal screening process to maintain the quality and consistency of the event. However, Boat chose to escalate the issue by accusing that the event standards are poor, the team is not transparent,
There has been an official clarification and apology, and no part indicates that there was discrimination or suppression to bully any individual.
From another perspective, this problem is not a systemic error of the event, but dissatisfaction from his own session not being selected, then linking it to other issues to make the matter seem more severe than it actually is. Maintaining event standards is important, and rejecting sessions that do not align with objectives/do not provide new perspectives to the audience is something that every quality event must do for the collective benefit of all participants.

Translation of Key Content from the Embedded Image (Boat's Facebook Post):
The image is a screenshot of a Facebook post by Charunthon Limseelo (dated October 2, with an update on October 2, 2025, at 8:19 PM). The post criticizes the organization of a tech event (likely "DevCon" or similar, involving sessions like "Vision to Delivery" and "Lightning Talk"). Here's a translated summary of the visible Thai text in the post:
"Update 2/10/2025 8:19 PM - I have received an official apology from the organizer. But the issue is not resolved yet.
I submitted a session on Tech Vision to Delivery, but it was rejected without any explanation. The organizer said they would notify the results by September 30, but on October 1, they posted the selected sessions without informing the submitters. This is unprofessional.
Then 2 months ago, I submitted another session on Lightning Talk, but again, no response. The deadline was September 30 (as per the caption in their post), but they announced the results without notifying.
I posted about this 2 months ago on Lightning Talk, but they ignored it. The Lightning Talk was supposed to be 15 minutes, but now it's only 5 minutes? And the event is on October 25, 2025.
This session I submitted was about 'Delivering AI with Microsoft Resource,' but no response. They just announced the selected ones without notifying the rejected ones. This is unprofessional, leading to a bad first impression.
Mistakes like this from a major event like DevCon are unprofessional. In my post, I didn't name the event, but people guessed it.
In the Lightning Talk example case, they didn't even notify the submitters.
Transparency, where is it?
[Below is an image of the event poster for 'Lightning Talk' on October 25, 2025, at K+ Building Samyan, with details like 'Submit your Lightning Talk 1 topic + abstract 1 topic' and event info.]
[Then an email screenshot:] Summary email Lightning Talk from Creator to bcc, from boat.charunthon@gmail.com, dated Oct 2, 2025, 1:41 PM, subject: To become Lightning Talk, with blurred content but mentioning submission details and possibly rejection or no response.]"
This appears to be Boat's original post complaining about lack of transparency in session selection for a tech conference.
