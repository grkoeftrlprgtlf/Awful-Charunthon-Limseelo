<br>Observation on the Use of the Title "Thai Student Tech Lead" of the Thai Programmers Association
Content:
In the FOSSASIA Summit event (at minute 00:33 of the video), Mr. Boat stated his own position as "Thai Student Tech Lead - Thai Programmer Association" and displayed it clearly.
Conflicting Facts:
From examining the working committee structure and official announcements of the Thai Programmers Association during that period, it was not found that the position "Thai Student Tech Lead" exists in the official administrative structure, and no announcement appointing Mr. Boat to hold the position as the association's representative at the international level was found at all.
This behavior falls under using the organization's name to create credibility for oneself (Self-credentialing) without the original organization possibly being aware or providing official endorsement, which creates misunderstanding among viewers, both Thai and foreign, that he is a representative of the association.
