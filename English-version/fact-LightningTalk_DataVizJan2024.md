A comparison of Mr. Boat’s presentations on two different occasions shows he provided personal information that was contradictory and did not align with the facts:
PyCon Thailand 2023 (Lightning Talk):
What Happened: In the video recording of the presentation, Mr. Boat showed a slide featuring a picture of him with another person. The text on the screen read “bf and gf,” and he stated into the microphone, “My girlfriend.”
The Reality: Following verification, this relationship status is confirmed to be false. The two individuals were not romantically involved.
Data Visualization Showcase (PDF Slide):
What Happened: In another set of presentation slides using the exact same photo, Mr. Boat changed the individual’s status, referring to the person simply as “my duo” (partner) instead.
Conclusion
The act of constantly switching the relationship status of an outside party—purely for the convenience of storytelling—suggests a lack of sincerity in his narratives. It shows that he is treating this person like a "prop" or character in his personal script, using them solely for entertainment or image building, without caring about whether the claims are factually accurate
