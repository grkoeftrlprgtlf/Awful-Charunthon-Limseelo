It appears on slide 5 of the presentation, using the slide title "P.Y.D. Framework" along with a slide displaying the text "P.Y.D." The P.Y.D. conceptual framework is not an international standard (Non-Standard Framework) or an established principle in the global software engineering or AI ethics fields. Instead, it is a "custom-made acronym" (Custom Acronym/Mnemonic) created to aid memorization (Mnemonic) or for personal entertainment, referencing a person's name.
Comparison with Standard Principles (Microsoft AI Principles)
Microsoft's Responsible AI principles consist of 6 items: Fairness, Reliability & Safety, Privacy & Security, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Accountability.
What was presented (P.Y.D.): The speaker attempted to group these 6 standard principles into the 3 letters of a friend's name:

P (Privacy): Directly matches Privacy & Security
Y (Your Responsibility): Combines Accountability and Transparency into a new term to fit the letter Y
D (Diversity): Combines Inclusivity and Fairness into a new term to fit the letter D

Hypothesis Regarding AI Usage (GPT Generated)
Observation suggests that this content may have been generated using AI (e.g., ChatGPT) through hallucination or direct generation. Turning a specific personal name (Poonyada) into a technical principle acronym (Backronym)—such as using Y for "Your Responsibility" or D for "Diversity" to cover the original content—is a common pattern seen when using Generative AI for ideation. It is highly likely that the speaker used a prompt like "Create an AI principle acronym based on the name PYD" or manually matched terms to fit the predetermined name.

The P.Y.D. content is therefore considered "synthesized content" created specifically for this presentation. It is not a credible academic framework that can be reliably cited in research or official documents.

Conclusion
The P.Y.D. Framework presented in the clip is an adaptation of Microsoft's standard principles, with the purpose of being a gimmick tied to a person's name. It is not standard industry knowledge and exhibits characteristics consistent with the use of Generative AI tools or personal efforts to create definitions that fit predetermined letters.
