From examining the content in the video clip recording the discussion on the topic "From Developer to Devfluencer in the AI Era," it was found that he declared himself under the status of "Devfluencer," which he defined as a developer who uses social media to create influence on thoughts. However, upon checking the actual qualifications and status as indicated by him in the presentation slide (at minute 04:47), the facts reveal that currently he holds the status of merely an "undergraduate student" in the Faculty of Engineering at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), and the claimed position of "Microsoft Student Ambassador" is merely a position in Microsoft's volunteer program for students to organize activities in educational institutions, not a position as a technical expert or professional software developer with real industry experience.

Additionally, in the part of the knowledge used for building his personal branding, from analyzing the content throughout the lecture (especially from minute 20:00 onwards), it was found that the information presented is not in-depth knowledge (Deep Tech) or innovations that he himself invented or developed, but rather a compilation of product information, tools, and technology trends that various technology companies have already publicly released (such as Generative AI, Google Opal), retold in the form of "reviews" or "summaries" through the perspective of a student.

Therefore, considering the evidence that appears, claiming the status of "Devfluencer" in this context is merely presenting a hypothetical role as a "information communicator" (Communicator) at the level of student activities, with no empirical evidence appearing in this clip that demonstrates high-level expertise or widely recognized engineering works in any way.
