Translation:
I know that what I wrote was technically impossible, but I admit that the wording I used went unchecked, and it could definitely cause misunderstandings (which, to be 100% clear, is my fault). I genuinely overstated the Session Information details; that shouldn't happen in the .NET framework.
I honestly wrote it really quickly at the time. I admit I thought to myself, "It's probably fine, no one is going to sit down and read this part in detail." (Well, now that’s a real lesson learned.) Another thing I’ve learned is that the person reviewing the proposal left this issue alone for six days before asking me about it, which started making it hard for me to figure out what was serious and what was a joke.
Please try not to send memes. I’m starting to not be able to tell the difference between what’s serious and what’s just fooling around.
The part where I exaggerated, I was trying to convey the idea of Sustainability (in the context of Training/Finetuning large models in .NET), and I know how sensitive that particular word is.
It really ended badly. Tonight, I need to sit down and reread everything about Wording, Context, and Professional Ethics from scratch.

Reviewing the content of this post reveals significant issues pointing toward Professional Misconduct and an ethics failure. We can break the analysis down into four main points:
1. Admission of Technical Fabrication (He Made It Up)
What he wrote:
“I knew there was no way it was possible, but due to the wording I used, I admit I didn't proofread.”
“I genuinely exaggerated the Session Information details which shouldn't happen in .NET.”
Explanation:
He flat-out admits he knew what he put in the proposal was technically impossible but chose to write it anyway to make the topic sound more exciting or overclaimed.
Analysis:
This is Intentional Deception, not an accidental oversight. Claiming he rushed or didn’t proofread is completely unacceptable at a professional level.
2. Deflection and Playing the Victim (The Blame Game)
What he wrote:
He focuses on the Time Gap: “The reviewer dropped this issue 6 days later.”
He claims the post was on his private Facebook page.
He mentions the conversation ended badly.
Explanation:
Instead of focusing on his own mistake (submitting false information), he immediately shifts the target to the reviewer's etiquette and timing. This is a classic DARVO technique (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender). He admits a minor fault, but immediately attacks the reviewer for being excessive or exposing him. He wants readers to sympathize with him and dislike the reviewer instead.
Analysis:
This is toxic behavior from someone who isn’t actually remorseful; they are just deeply embarrassed they got caught.
3. Gaslighting and "Tone Policing"
What he wrote:
“Please don’t send memes... I couldn't tell the difference between what was serious and what was a joke.”
Explanation:
He tries to use the context of the conversation—specifically that the reviewer sent a meme—as a self-serving excuse. He’s Gaslighting the reviewer and the public into believing that because the reviewer acted informally (sent a meme), he thought it was okay to put false information in his official work.
Analysis:
This is the most egregious form of Blame Shifting. The ethical integrity of the work is 100% the responsibility of the author, regardless of the conversational atmosphere. Bringing up memes is a desperate attempt to discredit the reviewer and cover up his own major technical lie.
4. Buzzword Stuffing (Talking Technical Nonsense)
What he wrote:
He linked the concept of "Sustainability" to Training/Finetuning large AI models using .NET.
Explanation:
He tried to justify his technical exaggeration by claiming the word "Sustainability" is sensitive. Technical Fact: Trying to use .NET for training/finetuning massive AI models (a job traditionally done by Python/PyTorch) in the name of sustainability is technically unsound and absurdly inefficient. Any actual developer reading that would instantly know it’s total nonsense.
Conclusion:
This proves he enjoys throwing around impressive buzzwords without having any deep technical knowledge or genuine understanding of the topic.
Executive Summary
This post confirms that Mr. Chalanthorn Limsilo exhibits the following behaviors:
A Liar: He admitted he wrote things he knew were impossible.
A Manipulator: He used Gaslighting, blaming the reviewer’s "memes" for his inability to discern professional boundaries.
Unprofessional: He lacks the maturity to distinguish between casual conversation and professional responsibility.
No Remorse: He spent the entire post deflecting and blaming others for exposing his wrongdoing.
This incident isn't just a "Lesson Learned," as he calls it. It's a track record that clearly shows he is untrustworthy in a professional setting.
