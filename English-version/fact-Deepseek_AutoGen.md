From the examination of the presentation document, it was found that Mr. Boat has exhibited ongoing behavior of distorting and exaggerating his status beyond reality (Credential Inflation), by stating his own position as "Thai Student Tech Lead", which is a position that does not exist in the structure of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA), and he has also given himself the nickname "Student AI Tech Influencer", which is considered an action lacking professionalism (Unprofessional) and intentionally creating an image of being a thought leader (Thought Leader). Therefore, we ask the community to use discretion in receiving information and news from the aforementioned individual.
