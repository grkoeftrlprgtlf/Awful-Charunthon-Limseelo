From examining the slide set "How To Run Reasoning Models..." (November 28, 2025), evidence of internal inconsistencies was found that points to the intent to create false information, as follows:
Timeline Stops (The Frozen Timeline) - Page 17: The event is held at the end of 2025, but the AI evolution timeline graph stops at "September 2024" and does not include the names of the models Gemini 3 or Gemma 3 that are used in the event headline appearing in the graph, showing that it is taking old slides and changing the title to deceive that it is new content.
Demo Doesn't Match the Cover (Code Discrepancy) - Page 52: The slide title indicates that it is a demonstration of "Gemini 3", but in the Python code screenshot image, it clearly calls model="mistral", which proves that the presenter did not actually run Gemini 3.
These behaviors confirm that the presenter uses the method of "Fabrication" (fabricating information) to create an image of an expert, lacking academic accuracy.
