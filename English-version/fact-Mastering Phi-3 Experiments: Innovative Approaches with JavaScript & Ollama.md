This section appears between minutes 10:19 and 10:40 of the presentation, using the slide title "Simple Responsible AI principles for SLMs."
1. The Fact about the Origin of P.Y.D.
The video clearly shows the presenter stating: "I wanted to shorten it to just three letters: P, Y, and D... which are the initials of my friend's name." (at 10:26). The accompanying slide reads: "P.Y.D. = Poonyada."
The P.Y.D. framework is not an international standard (Non-Standard Framework) or an existing principle in global software engineering or AI ethics. Instead, it is a Custom Acronym/Mnemonic created by the presenter, either to aid memory or purely for personal entertainment, referencing a specific person’s name.
2. Comparison with Standard Principles (Microsoft AI Principles)
Microsoft's six Responsible AI principles are: Fairness, Reliability & Safety, Privacy & Security, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Accountability.
What was presented (P.Y.D.): The presenter attempted to group these six standard principles into the three letters of their friend's name:
P (Privacy): Aligns with Privacy & Security.
Y (Your Responsibility): This bundles Accountability and Transparency into a new term to fit the letter Y.
D (Diversity): This bundles Inclusivity and Fairness into a new term to fit the letter D.
3. Hypothesis on AI Usage (GPT Generated)
It is observed that this content may have been generated using AI (such as ChatGPT Hallucination/Generation). The process of taking a specific personal name (Poonyada) and engineering it into technical principles (Backronym) by using terms like Y for Your Responsibility or D for Diversity to cover existing concepts is a common pattern when using Generative AI for ideation.
It is highly probable that the presenter used a prompt like: "Create an AI principle acronym based on the name PYD," or manually attempted to match words to fit the specific initials.
Therefore, the P.Y.D. section is considered "Synthesized Content," created specifically for this presentation. It is not a scholarly reliable framework that can be cited in research or official documents.
Conclusion
The P.Y.D. Framework presented in the clip is an Adaptation of standard Microsoft principles, primarily serving as a Gimmick based on a personal name. It is not an industry standard body of knowledge and strongly aligns with either the use of Generative AI tools or a deliberate personal effort to create definitions that fit pre-selected initials.
