Analysis of Manipulative Behavior and Inflated Self Image (Social Halo Effect Analysis) of “Recap 2025 (3/3)” End-of-Year Post

Based on the post titled “Recap2025 (3/3)”, several suspicious behaviors were identified that fall under systematic social deception. These behaviors rely heavily on “name-dropping” the frequent mention of wellknown individuals and organizations (such as SCB 10X, Techsauce, and THE STANDARD) to manufacture associative credibility and ride on external reputations, despite the absence of technically meaningful contributions or verifiable work.

The most serious issue is the statement regarding Microsoft MVP status: “I’ll see later whether I’ll renew my MVP or not.” This constitutes intentional misinformation, because in reality, in 2025 the individual’s actual status is only Student Ambassador (student level). The term “renew” cannot be used with the MVP title, which is a professional level designation. This phrasing is a deliberate linguistic trap designed to mislead readers unfamiliar with Microsoft’s program structure into believing that the individual already holds MVP status. This is a clear case of lying to elevate one’s social standing (social climbing).

Furthermore, the public shift in positioning from Developer to “Generalist” and “Devfluencer” is analyzed as a strategy of technical deficiency whitewashing using business buzzwords and references to prominent figures to obscure the lack of concrete, evidence based output. While the post claims to have “shared insights” or “engaged” with national level teams, there is no accompanying hard evidence such as source code, research papers, or tangible projects in which the individual played a core role.
<br>
This pattern reflects the intent to present oneself as a pseudo expert, prioritizing PR driven visibility and perceived connections over actual competence. In conclusion, this post serves as significant evidence of deliberate information distortion to inflate personal credentials, and readers should be cautious of claims that exaggerate mere event attendance into alleged business or strategic partnerships.
