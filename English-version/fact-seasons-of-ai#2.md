Incident: Microsoft Season of AI Presentation Slide 37
Facts:
Creation of a Personal Acronym: The presenter explicitly stated that "P.Y.D." comes from a friend's nickname ("Poonyada"). He then tried to force the principles of Responsible AI to fit the letters of this person's name (P, Y, D).
Distortion of Standard Principles: Microsoft’s Responsible AI principles comprise six concepts (Fairness, Reliability, Privacy, etc.). The presenter abbreviated and distorted the terminology (e.g., using "Y - Your Responsibility" instead of "Accountability") simply to align with his friend's name.
Using a private personal name to define a framework on a technology stage and presenting it as a key principle to remember undermines the credibility of the academic content. It confuses students, who may mistakenly believe it is an international standard, and demonstrates a lack of professionalism on the part of the speaker.
Conclusion: The P.Y.D. Framework is not technical terminology or an engineering standard; it is merely a "Personal Gimmick" created without responsibility for the accuracy of the content.
