An audit of the "Young Entrepreneur Lab" activity posted by Mr. Charunthon Limseelo on December 11, 2025, reveals professional ethics issues:
Analysis of the text points to the following ethical abnormalities:
1. Brand Hijacking via Hashtag (Brand Misrepresentation)
Evidence in the Post: The last line uses the Hashtag #MSFTStudentambassador.
Post Content: The entire content of the post discusses "Opal" (a Google Labs product) and using Prompts to create a Web App.
Analysis: This is the clearest evidence of hypocrisy. The purpose of using the #MSFTStudentambassador hashtag is generally to report the activity back to Microsoft to gain recognition/points or to display his affiliation. However, the activity being reported was teaching a Google product (Opal).
Verdict: This constitutes Misleading behavior toward both the readers and the Microsoft system. Slapping a Microsoft label on a Google product is a serious violation of activity etiquette.
2. Intentional Selection of a Competitor’s Tool
Evidence in the Post: "I took the time to do my homework and ultimately decided to teach Opal to the attendees."
Analysis: This sentence confirms the choice was premeditated, not an unavoidable circumstance. As a Gold MSFT Ambassador, he is fully aware that Microsoft offers comparable Low-code/No-code Business Application tools (such as Power Platform or Azure AI Studio). His deliberate decision to "choose Opal" instead of tools from his own sponsoring camp suggests he prioritized following the "Trend" set by Google over his "Duty" as a Microsoft Ambassador.
3. Using VIPs as a Shield (Social Validation Shield)
Evidence in the Post: He Mentioned and thanked numerous high-profile individuals (P’Jess, P’Mek, MP P’Oil, P’Vee, P’Peach, etc.).
Analysis: Tagging these prominent figures serves two psychological purposes:
Builds Credibility: It makes the workshop (and the act of teaching Google Opal under the guise of Microsoft) appear validated and accepted by senior leadership.
Defense Mechanism: Should anyone question the appropriateness of the activity, he can use these names as an "Appeal to Authority," implying: "Even the senior figures liked it."

AvaX 's Young Entrepreneur Lab #1 at AIS Siam Square - AI-First Entrepreneur Workshop: Featuring Opal
.
Hello, everyone! 🙏
.
Last Saturday (December 6, 2025), was another non-technical session that was incredibly interesting. This time, we focused on applying AI to start businesses, especially for modern entrepreneurs who use AI to boost the success of their business presentations. The session I ran took about 15 minutes—I did my homework beforehand and ultimately decided to teach Opal to the attendees at the event.
.
Opal is a Low-Code Platform where we can easily build things by simply using a Prompt for the flow we want. This can be developed into a simple Web App that doesn't require a complex setup at all. Briefly, it’s great for quickly presenting something. However, Opal also allows us to Drag-n-Drop components, although there might be issues when prompting to edit the flow. It is still experimental right now, but you can definitely try it out!
.
The example Case I demonstrated was a flow used to visualize our business’s Brand Visualizer. It takes data from our Business Model Canvas and performs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) behind the scenes to produce results that can be used for presentations and pitching. You can check out the Prompt used in the image attached to this post.
.
Finally, I want to thank P’Jess Paksikorn, and extend my thanks to P’Mek and MP P’Oil for giving me the opportunity to present something new for friends and colleagues to apply. I also feel extremely honored to have worked with many people at the event, including P’Vee, P’Peach, P’Nutty, and many others whom I can’t possibly list entirely.
.
And for the biggest inspiration for this session, I would like to thank P’Aon Prin for providing ideas on integrating AI with business at past events, which enabled me to apply them here and help many people understand how to use AI. 🙏❤️
.
The actual slides were only distributed at the event, but if anyone wants them, feel free to message me! 🙏🏻 I hope this post is helpful to everyone.
